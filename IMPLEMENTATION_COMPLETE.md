## ⚡ Quick Start:

3. Copy-paste the code sections
4. Test each command

## 🎯 Recommendation:

**Add these 5 commands now** - they're the most useful and don't require external APIs or files:
- ✅ `/freeze` - New attack type
- ✅ `/stop_freeze` - Control
- ✅ `/info` - Utility (uses existing API)
- ✅ `/quick` - Improved `/r`
- ✅ `/stop all` - Convenience

Then later, if you want, add:
- `/dm`, `/friend`, `/multijoin` (require more setup)
- `/bio` (requires credentials file)
- `/wladd`, `/wlremove` (require whitelist system)
